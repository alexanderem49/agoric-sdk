The Agoric OpCo engineering team is pleased to publish the **`$TAG`** release. This release is primarily intended to $REASON.

The following new features are included in this release:

- #$ISSUE: $DESCRIPTION

The release contains at least the following fixes:

- #$ISSUE: $DESCRIPTION

The full set of changes in this release can be found at https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/pull/$RELEASE_PR.

This code has satisfied all pre-release/testnet validation checks, and is now recommended for chains to upgrade from the previous `$PREV_RELEASE` release. As a state-machine-breaking upgrade, once approved, all chain validators will need to upgrade from `$PREV_RELEASE` to this new version (after the chain halts due to reaching the height required in a governance proposal).

Since the `agoric-upgrade-11` release, state-sync snapshots include more data than before. Nodes which have inadvertently pruned this data (e.g. those created from a state-sync before the `agoric-upgrade-11` release) will not be able to produce such snapshots, and will need to be restored from state-sync. We are aware of continued performance issues related to state-sync. In particular, we've observed that on some deployments, the current implementation can require 100 GB of temporary free disk space and 16GB of memory.

Below is the _cosmos upgrade handler name_ for this release. This is the name that can be used in governance proposals to deploy this upgrade.

```
Cosmos Upgrade Handler Name: $COSMOS_UPGRADE_NAME
```

Below is the git information related to this software release. Note the _git tag_ does not always match the _cosmos upgrade handler name_.

```
Git Tag: $TAG
Git Commit: $COMMIT
@agoric/cosmos package version: $AGORIC_COSMOS_VERSION
Docker: ghcr.io/agoric/agoric-sdk:$DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG
```

As shown in go.mod this release is based on:

```
ibc-go $IBC_GO_VERSION
cosmos-sdk $COSMOS_SDK_VERSION
cometbft $COMETBFT_VERSION
```

## How to upgrade

Presuming that your node is running `$PREV_RELEASE`, once the upgrade height for a subsequent proposal to upgrade to `$TAG` has been reached, your node will halt automatically allowing you to upgrade the agoric stack.

```
# prepare by installing Go 1.20.2 or higher, Node 16 or 18, clang 10 or gcc 10
# stop the agd service
cd agoric-sdk
git fetch --all
git checkout $TAG
yarn install
yarn build
(cd packages/cosmic-swingset && make)
#start the agd service
```

Do _not_ copy the `agd` script or Go binary to another location. If you would like to have an executable `agd` in another location, then create a symlink in that location pointing to `agoric-sdk/bin/agd`.

### Node Version

Node.js 16.13 or higher (previous LTS) or Node.js 18.12 or higher (maintenance LTS).
Please note the current active LTS of Node 20 is not yet officially supported.

### Golang Version

The `$TAG` release requires Go 1.20.2 or higher.

### C Compiler Version

Clang version 10 or GCC version 10 required.

### Troubleshooting `repoconfig.sh: No such file or directory`

Unlike typical cosmos-sdk chains where the daemon is a single executable file, Agoric's use of cosmos-sdk depends on many components of `agoric-sdk` at runtime. Copying `agd` to `/usr/local/bin` or the like is unlikely to produce a working installation. For more detail, see: https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/issues/7825

### Troubleshooting `Cannot find dependency ...` in systemd

If you have `LimitNOFILE=4096` in your systemd unit file, change it to `LimitNOFILE=65536`. For more detail, see https://github.com/Agoric/agoric-sdk/issues/7817

## Specifying `--upgrade-info` for the software upgrade proposal

The `./scripts/gen-upgrade-proposal.sh` is designed to aid in composing a `agd tx submit-proposal software-upgrade ...` command. In particular, it captures package checksums to verify integrity of downloaded software.
